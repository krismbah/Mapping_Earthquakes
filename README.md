# Mapping_Earthquakes

## Overview

The purpose of this analysis is to see the earthquake data in relation to the tectonic platesâ€™ location on the earth, the earthquakes with a magnitude greater than 4.5 on the map, and the data on a third map. The following tasks are to be completed: 

1. Add Tectonic Plate Data.
2. Add Major Earthquake Data.
3. Add an Additional Map.

## Results

***Deliverable 1: Add Tectonic Plate Data***
Using knowledge of JavaScript, Leaflet.js, and geoJSON data, add tectonic plate data using d3.json(), add the data using the geoJSON() layer, set the tectonic plate LineString data to stand out on the map, and add the tectonic plate data to the overlay object with the earthquake data:

***Deliverable 2: Add Major Earthquake Data***
Using knowledge of JavaScript, Leaflet.js, and geoJSON data, add major earthquake data to the map using d3.json(). Also add color and set the radius of the circle markers based on the magnitude of earthquake, and add a popup marker for each earthquake that displays the magnitude and location of the earthquake using the GeoJSON layer, geoJSON():

***Deliverable 3: Create a Gauge Chart***
Using knowledge of JavaScript and Leaflet.js add a third map style to the earthquake map:

## Summary

To summarize, our biological researchers collaborated to discover and document bacterial species which may be unknown to science. In particular, our researchers are interested in bacterial species which have the ability to synthesize proteins that taste like beef. Our prominent laboratory has partnered with Improbable Beef (a food start-up) to research candidate species. Labs across the country have had success in synthesizing "meat" from algae, fungi, and microorganisms found on plant roots. However, Improbable Beef is still searching for the illusive bacteria that will provide the perfect taste. It is our hypothesis that there is a microorganism that can supply the next best taste. And we believe it can be found in bacteria found on the human body. The human body is a source for thousands of types of bacteria and different parts of the body harbor different species. We hypothesize that the ideal bacterial species to create synthetic beef may be found in the belly button. To test our hypothesis, we have sampled the navels of people from across the United States to identify bacterial species which colonize our belly buttons. Each volunteer's identity is anonymous and has been assigned an id number in order to protect their privacy. This dashboard was created for research participants to access in order to learn which bacterial species live in their navels For futher development of the webpage, the following customizations were implemented:

1. Add an image to the jumbotron.
2. Add background color or a variety of compatible colors to the webpage.
3. Add more information about the project as a paragraph on the page.
